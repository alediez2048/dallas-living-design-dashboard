## Excel File Structure Requirements

The dashboard expects Excel files (`.xlsx` or `.xls`) with a specific structure. Follow these guidelines to ensure proper parsing:

### Header Structure

- **Row 6 (Index 5)**: Main header row containing column names such as:
  - `PROJECT NAME`
  - `PROJECT #`
  - `Phase`
  - `Sector` (recommended - makes sector identification much easier)
  - `Eligible for reporting?`
  - `Operational Carbon`
  - `Embodied Carbon`
  - `Switch List Vetted`
  - `Air`, `Light`, `Thermal Comfort`, `Acoustic Perform`, `Water Quality`, `Biophilia`
  - `Ecology`
  - `Resilience - 1~3`

- **Row 7 (Index 6)**: Sub-header row containing detailed metrics:
  - `Predicted Net EUI`
  - `AIA Baseline EUI`
  - `Ttl Flow: Potable Water Use Reduction`
  - Other sub-metrics under main categories

### Data Rows

- **Row 9 onwards (Index 8+)**: Project data rows
- Each project row should have:
  - A valid Project Number (numeric, at least 4 characters)
  - A Project Name
  - **Sector value** (in the Sector column, if present)

### Sector Column (Recommended)

**The easiest way to specify sectors is to add a `Sector` column in Row 6 (main header row).**

The parser will:
1. **First priority**: Use the value from the `Sector` column for each project row
2. **Fallback**: If the Sector column is missing or empty, it will detect sectors from project names

**Supported sector values** (case-insensitive, partial matches supported):
- **K12**: "K12", "K-12", "School"
- **Higher ED**: "Higher ED", "Higher Education", "University", "College", "Campus"
- **CCC**: "CCC", "Civic", "Cultural", "Community", "Museum", "Library"
- **Healthcare DIV**: "Healthcare DIV", "Healthcare", "Health"
- **Diversified Healthcare Interiors**: "Diversified Healthcare Interiors", "Diversified", "Div" (when not part of "HCA")
- **Healthcare HCA**: "Healthcare HCA", "HCA"
- **Workplace**: "Workplace", "Corporate", "Commercial", "Office"

The parser normalizes these values automatically, so variations like "K-12", "K12", or "School" will all map to "K12" in the dashboard.

### Eligibility Status

The `Eligible for reporting?` column accepts:
- `Yes` or `Y` → Marked as eligible
- `TBD` → Status pending
- `No 2026` → Not eligible until 2026
- `No` or empty → Not eligible

### Key Metrics Columns

The parser looks for these specific column names (case-insensitive, partial matches):

**Resilience & Regeneration:**
- `Predicted Net EUI` (sub-header)
- `AIA Baseline EUI` (sub-header)
- `Operational Carbon` (main header)
- `Embodied Carbon` (main header)
- `Ttl Flow: Potable Water Use Reduction` (sub-header)
- `Ecology` (main header)
- `Resilience - 1~3` (main header)

**Health & Well-being:**
- `Switch List Vetted` (main header)
- `Air` (main header)
- `Light` (main header)
- `Thermal Comfort` (main header)
- `Acoustic Perform` (main header)
- `Water Quality` (main header)
- `Biophilia` (main header)

**General:**
- `Sector` (main header) - **Recommended**: Makes sector identification much easier and more accurate

### Example File Structure

```
Row 1-5: [Metadata/Title rows - ignored]
Row 6:    [PROJECT NAME | PROJECT # | Phase | Eligible for reporting? | Operational Carbon | ...]
Row 7:    [           |           |       |                        | Predicted Net EUI | ...]
Row 8:    [Empty or separator row]
Row 9+:   [Project data rows]
```

## Usage

1. **Upload Excel File**: 
   - Click the upload area or drag and drop your Excel file
   - Supported formats: `.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.csv`

2. **View Dashboard**:
   - The dashboard automatically loads and displays all projects
   - Use sector tabs to filter by specific sectors
   - Hover over chart elements for detailed tooltips

3. **Navigate**:
   - Use the sidebar to switch between views (currently Overview is active)
   - Click "Reset Data" to clear the current dataset and upload a new file

4. **Debug Mode**:
   - Click the "Debug Parser" button in the bottom-right corner
   - View detailed parsing logs to troubleshoot file structure issues

## Technologies Used

- **React 18** - UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **Recharts** - Data visualization
- **Framer Motion** - Animations
- **XLSX** - Excel file parsing
- **Lucide React** - Icons

## Troubleshooting

### File Not Parsing Correctly

1. **Check File Structure**: Ensure your Excel file follows the structure outlined above
2. **Enable Debug Mode**: Click "Debug Parser" to see detailed parsing logs
3. **Verify Headers**: Make sure Row 6 and Row 7 contain the expected column names
4. **Check Sector Detection**: If sectors aren't detected, ensure sector names match the supported patterns

### Build Warnings

The build may show warnings about chunk sizes. This is normal for applications with chart libraries. The build is optimized with code splitting to minimize load times.

### Performance

- Large files (1000+ projects) may take a few seconds to parse
- The table displays up to 100 projects at a time for performance
- All data processing happens client-side (no server required)

## Deployment

This project is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.

### Automated Deployment

Every push to the `main` branch triggers an automated deployment workflow:
1. Code is checked out
2. Dependencies are installed
3. Production build is created
4. Build artifacts are deployed to GitHub Pages

### Manual Deployment to Other Platforms

The `dist/` folder contains the production build. You can also deploy to:

- **Vercel**: `vercel deploy`
- **Netlify**: Drag and drop the `dist/` folder
- **AWS S3**: Upload `dist/` contents to an S3 bucket with static hosting enabled
